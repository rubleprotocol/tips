## What is a TP?
A TRON protocol (TP) is a design document describing a particular protocol,
standard, or feature which is already implemented in TRON but not published as a TIP.
A TP should list the properties of the standard, explain the design rationale, and
provide a concise but comprehensive technical specification that can guide developers to implement it conveniently with any other languages.
A TP should not be used for indicating a specific implementation(such as java-tron) or debating governance proposals.

## Components
A TP and TIP have similar components, which include a header, a concise summary, an abstract, the motivation, the specification, the rationale, the implementation and a copyright notice. TP is an implemented protocol, so the implementation module can include a core code of java-tron.
All top-level sections are required.
References should be included inline as links or tabulated at the bottom of the section if necessary.

## Formatting
### General
TP specifications must be written in GitHub Flavoured Markdown.

### Language
TP specifications should be written in simple English, avoiding obscure terminologies and unnecessary jargons.
The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in specifications are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
### Pseudocode
Pseudocode in specifications should be language-agnostic and formatted in a simple standard, with line numbers, variables, simple conditional blocks, for loops, and
the English fragments are necessary to explain further functionality.
