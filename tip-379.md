## Simple Summary

Optimize VM execution.

## Abstract

Optimize VM execution by caching contract, runtime code and programPreCompile for hot smart contract with LRU.

## Motivation

Once smart contract is deployed, its definition and code cannot be changed.
So we can cache some smart contracts that are frequently called for transaction execution. This will reduce the overhead of contract transaction execution.

When we execute the `JUMP` and `JUMPI` instruction, we need to get the jump destination. The current vm gets the jump destination, we need to compile the code, which requires a lot of operations. We know that the jump destination of the same code is the same. If we cache the hot runtime code jump destination, we can greatly reduce the compile operation.

## Specifications

### Maintaining contract and code's LRUMap:

```
private static final LRUMap<Key, ContractCapsule> contractLruCache;
private static final LRUMap<Key, byte[]> codeLruCache;
```
By command `--lru-cache-size` or add `vm.lruCacheSize` parameter in config file, we can set cache size and default size is 500.

There are four scenarios that will cause the cache to be removedï¼š

```
1. The LRUMap is full and remove cache least recently used.
2. The contract selfdestruct.
3. Update contract's energy_limit.
4. Update contract's consume_user_resource_percent.
```

### Maintaining programPreComile's LRUMap:

```
private static final LRUMap<Key, ProgramPrecompile> programPrecompileLRUMap
```
The key is codehash.

## Benchmark

We performed performance tests on the vm execution before and after optimization. We took the market numbers of justlend as a test case, and the results comparison found that the number of supported market increased by 50% after optimization.

Before optimization:

|   markets    | out of time tx / total tx | timeout rate     |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
|     32       |          52/3374          |      1.54%       |
|     36       |          225/5032         |      4.47%       |
|     40       |          365/3087         |      11.82%      |
|     44       |          485/1214         |      39.95%      |
|     46       |          929/1174         |      79.13%      |
|     48       |          959/1036         |      92.57%      |

After optimization:

|   markets    | out of time tx / total tx | timeout rate     |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------- |
|     61       |          134/2464         |      5.44%       |
|     65       |          200/2124         |      9.42%       |
|     68       |          930/2604         |      35.71%      |
|     70       |          999/1653         |      60.44%      |
|     72       |          855/1096         |      78.01%      |
|     74       |          1682/1898        |      88.62%      |
