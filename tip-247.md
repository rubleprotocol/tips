## Simple Summary

A widely used pBFT consensus can provide faster confirmation time as well as larger TPS, which leads to some top blockchain companies start to introduce and implement it. Based on tron previous DPoS consensus, a modified version of pBFT combined with tron DPoS consensus give a better performance and expand tron ecosystem like cross-chain project that uses tron mix consensus for block verification.   
This TIP mainly describes newly tron mix consensus algorithm and give some explanation how it works on tron blockchain. In addition, talk about comparison between old tron consensus and newly mix consensus algorithm.

## Abstract

Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance is a consensus algorithm used in asynchronous distributed system that keeps the entire distributed system available on the condition of partition failure. Besides, pBFT can provide a global consensus state between different nodes, which is highly demand in the blockchain. By tailoring pBFT message types, mix tron consensus only require three type of pBFT messages, combined with DPoS can give a better performance and shrink block confirmation time to only 1 or 2 slot time on average.

## Motivation 

In the current DPoS consensus mechanism of TRON Protocol, the average confirmation time for one block is equal to (2/3 * Number of SRs) slots. With the adoption of pBFT consensus algorithm, however, the confirmation time will shrink significantly to only 1 or 2 slot time if the network environment is good enough. In addition, newly tron mixed consensus can alway provide solidity block header information for query, there is no unconfirmed state block in newly mixed pBFT chain. In this scenario, cross-chain and SPV can be implemented by querying valid block header information from pBFT chain built on mixed tron consensus. 

## Specification

### Node 

- SR(Super representative): nodes that produce blocks
- Verifier: nodes that trigger the pBFT consensus procedure for blocks produced by SRs
- Full node: normal nodes that supervise the consensus behavior above

### Message type in pBFT

                          <center> Figure 1 </center>

- VIEW_CHANGE: usually happen when primary fail 
- REQUEST:  on the stage of client send a request to primary replica
- PRE_PREPARE: on the stage of other replicas receive message from primary replica 
- PREPARE: receive multicast pre_prepare message 
- COMMIT:  receive multicast prepare message

### Message type in tron mixed consensus 

- PRE_PREPARE : will be generated while processing blocks (SR)
- PREPARE :  will be generated once done with processing blocks (SR)
- COMMIT :  will be generated once Verifiers receive 2/3+1 valid signed prepare messages (Verifier)


## Rationale 

Normally,there are `request->Pre-prepare->prepare->commit->reply`  five types of message on pBFT , but with optimized tron pBFT , there are only `pre_prepare->prepare->commit` three types of message, which is much easier to manipulate and implement. By combining with current tron consensus algorithm, the first phase is block broadcasting, which is equivalent to the pre_prepare phase of traditional pBFT; the second phase is the vote stage where blocks are verified, equivalent to the prepare phase of traditional pBFT; the third phase is verifying vote results, equivalent to the commit phase of traditional pBFT. Below are the details(SR can be verifier too):
1. SRs will broadcast the block once done with producing it 
2. Upon receiving the broadcast block, Verifiers will validate it, then sign and broadcast prepare message
3. Upon receiving signed prepare messages from more than 2/3+1 Verifiers, a commit message will be generated, which will then be signed and broadcasted by Verifiers
4. If nodes receive signed commit messages from more than 2/3+1 Verifiers, it is deemed that the current block can never be reverted

                          <center> Figure 2 </center>

Firstly, SR will take turn to produce and broadcast blocks and generate a pre_prepare message. Secondly, Verifiers alway listen to channel and monitor if there is a coming produced blocks, if yes and start to validate and process. Once everything is passed, Verifiers will broadcast prepare message with their signatures to trigger the pBFT consensus procedure. And then Verifiers also check whether they receive 2/3+1 signed prepare message in this round, if yes and then will generate a commit message with their signature and then broadcast it. 

Such round of pBFT consensus procedure will be conducted every time when a block is processed. In order to valid block header, their PBFT information will be saved to local database through putBlockSignData function and ready for verification in the lightweight clients.

Each node only votes one time on same block height;messages already received will be discarded right away. Meanwhile, if the node fails to confirm the prepare messages upon receiving commit messages, the current commit messages need to be cached.

TRON's optimized pBFT consensus algorithm also features a Timeout mechanism. If a round of pBFT algorithm fails to reach finality within a given period of time, all data related to this round will be cleared by all nodes. But one difference from the traditional pBFT is that TRON will not re-initiate this round.

- Fork  
 
  Rule 1: always choose the fork chain which first receive 2/3 +1 Verifiers replices commit messages as main chain. Rule 2 : if no any block receive 2/3 +1 commit message, then chose longer chain as the main chain. Follow order rule1->No->rule2.

- Other 

  Threshold signature scheme can help handle multisignature schemes related to the PBFT consensus algorithm. Using threshold signature schemes in the signature module and the verification module will make the entire system simpler and more efficient. Therefore, we plan to utilize this technology in the upcoming versions.

Notice: SR can be Verifier 


### Comparison

Basically, by adding multiple Verifiers in the current tron network shorten the block confirmation time. Current tron consensuses algorithm always require 2f+1 =19 nodes to confirm block, which take 19 slot time, while optimized tron pBFT only require 2/3+1 verifiers to confirm blocker, which take less times in comparing with former one since network request can be handled by few seconds.
Consider about slide windows model, Current tron consensus algorithm only move one slot every pass, while optimized tron pBFT can move multiple slot once receiver 2/3+1 Verifiers replies. Below is current tron consensus algorithm:
 ```
     Tron window:       start..........................End
      Block     A  ----> B->C...........17..........--->R                    (a)
      Status  solid ---> unconfirmed->...........->unconfirmed
 ```
Initially, slide window starts from the first unconfirmed block, the size is 1, then will increase windows size as the number of unconfirmed block increase. Once windows size reach threshold say 19+1, which is R in above, then make Bâ€˜s status to be solid, move into C, decrease windows size by one, which is 19.And continue to move once start point block of windows become solid status.
When combined with optimized tron pBFT, the windows can move faster.
```
 Tron window:     start....................................End
 optimized:       start                  end(receives message)              (b)
 Block     A  ----> B----->C------>D------>E..............--->R
 Status  solid ---> unconfirmed->...................->unconfirmed
```
For optimized PBFT, slide window starts from the first unconfirmed block with size of 1,  will increase windows size as the number of unconfirmed block increase when 2/3+1 relies commit message from verifiers not be received.  Once get more than 2/3+1 replies commit messages from verifiers stating that block E is valid, which proves that block E on (b) is valid, which draws a conclusion that B,C,D,E are all valid and can be marked as solid status since each block hash relies precious block hash . In this case, the slide windows move super faster in comparing with tron windows before tron windows reach thresholds-19.  In best case, which means no fork and network is good means a slot time is enough to receive verifier replicas messages, both of them have the same move speed after tron windows size reach threshold. However, if there is a fork on the main chain, then tron window (a) reset windows size and wait for 19 blocks time to confirm while optimized windows (b) can maintenance the same move speed. More detail: See the proof the correctness of optimized pBFT.
  
Notice: even if (a) and (b) have same window moving speed, the transaction confirm time of (a) is much bigger than (b) since it need to wait more than 2f+1 block to be produced to valid a block

## Implementation


### Data types   


```typescript

public class PbftMessage

```

PbftMessage: Type indicates the vote message type.

Raw indicates the data that need to be signed, which mainly include: msg_type, data_type, time, view_n, data and epoch.

Sign indicates SR's signature on the entire raw data.

```typescript

message PBFTMessage {
  enum MsgType {
    VIEW_CHANGE = 0;
    REQUEST = 1;
    PREPREPARE = 2;
    PREPARE = 3;
    COMMIT = 4;
  }
  enum DataType {
    BLOCK = 0;
    SRL = 1;
  }
  message Raw {
    MsgType msg_type = 1;
    DataType data_type = 2;
    int64 view_n = 3;
    int64 epoch = 4;
    bytes data = 5;
  }
  Raw raw_data = 1;
  bytes signature = 2;
}

```

```typescript

public class PBFTCommitResult

```

PBFTCommitResult is mainly used to store signed messages.

Data indicates the data signed by SRs; sign indicates SR's signature on data. These two concepts correspond to data and data_sign in PbftMessage.

```typescript

message PBFTCommitResult {
  bytes data = 1;
  repeated bytes signature = 2;
}

```


### Required functions     
         
Set the signature data of the current epoch SR list. Cycle means being currently in that epoch.   

```typescript

public boolean putSrSignData(long cycle, PbftSignCapsule item)

```

Get the signature data of the current epoch SR list

```typescript

PbftSignCapsule getSrSignData(long cycle)

```

Set the signature data of the current block (namely the SR signature list)

```typescript

public void putBlockSignData(long blockNum, PbftSignCapsule item): Set

```

Get the signature data of the current block (namely the SR signature list)

```typescript

public PbftSignCapsule getBlockSignData(long blockNum)

```

Each vote is recorded as a message, so we define a message structure, PbftMessage, to cover all vote messages; please see full details under data structure.

```typescript

public class PbftMessage

```

PbftBaseMessage encapsulates PbftMessage and supports features such as signing validation messages and creating prepare and commit messages

```typescript

public class PbftBaseMessage

```
