## Simple Summary

This tip mainly describes SPV and how it works on cross-chain. In addition, also discusses a solution to support tron version SPV. 

## Abstract

Currently, SPV play a very important role in cross-chain project since it can provide fast transaction verification on light weight client such as wallets. Those clients only store block header information for verification purpose. However, there are might be tampering attack on block producing and confirm stage, which may lead to switch chain or do another fork. With tron version SPV, it ensures the correctness of block that you use to do SPV.

## Motivation

In Bitcoin world, most of users do not have mining machine, and they do not have enough resource to run a full node. For now, you need 500GB hard drive space to store the entire blockchain data and a solid state drive is preferred. For most users, what they need, is only selling and buying. Since they don't care about the verification process, a mining machine seems a bit redundant. SPV appears to solve this problem. SPV is lightweight, as it stores only block headers, a few MBs space is required. From the block headers, we are able to know whether the transaction appears in a block, which can prove whether it has been verified.

Tron version of SPV provides extra correctness and security for block query, which safeguards block and transactions verification process.  

## Specification

### Merkle Tree   
Basically, Merkle tree, named after Ralph C. Merkle who is a famous cryptographers, is like a hash tree, which uses hash function to connect with each node. The value of leaf node in Merkle tree is a data block hash, while hash value of non-leaf node is a hash of hashing several other nodes' hash values. It's like we can hash two leaves hash value into a non-leave hash, which is the root of those two.

- Features: 
     1.  highly efficient: To validate transactions, just compare the root hash of those transactions, see if they are equal or not. 

     2.  highly secure: If transaction C changes, then it will lead to hash value change of N2, N5 and root. So, it is impossible to create a fake transaction within SPV. In addition, fast troubleshot can be done by comparing the different hash value of the nodes. Like the above example, From root → N5 → N2 hash value will change, and then we could locate the change of transaction C.


### Epoch   
    Every six hours is called Epoch in tron. In other words, a cycle for producing a certain number of blocks.

### SR List 
 
   SR list is type of data structure used for block verification, which includes nextSrList and sr_signature. SRL will be calculated in each maintenance period, which stores a list of SR address on next epoch. For block verification, just check block if there is 2/3+1 SR that sign this blocks in the SR list or not. 

```
message SRL {
  repeated bytes srAddress = 1;
}

```


#### Threshold Signature

1. At least t  participants in the group can collaborate to generate a valid signature on behalf of the group signature.
2. Any one who plays the role of a veriﬁer can use the group’s public key to verify the group signature with-out identifying the identities of the signers

### Verifier
  nodes that trigger the pBFT consensus procedure for blocks produced by SRs

## Rationale

### SPV process
 
1. Get the transaction hash.
2. From a full node, getting the corresponding Merkle proof.
3. Base on Merkle path, doing Markle proof and finally get Merkle root.
4. Comparing local Merkle root with the calculated one.
5. Judging if the transaction is legal from whether the result is equivalent to the local Merkle Root.

Basically, given a transaction hash and using that hash query full node to get block header as well as Merkle path. Based on Merkle path and feature of Merkle tree, we can easily calculate new Merkle root and then we can compare with local Merkle root, if match, then it is valid transaction, otherwise, it is fake one. 

### SPV on tron

In DPOS consensus every slot is assigned to the only legal SR, So within one schedule if verifiers know the legal SR list they can verify every block header easily. Since verifiers don't process most transaction including vote transaction. they have no way to know the voting result. In other words they are unable to know the next legal SR list. The focus of this problem is how to handle the maintenance period correctly. Based on the above reasons we can solve this problem by recording SR list in one type of BPFT messages which are sent by the previous legal SR list we trust. 

The most process of tron version SPV is the same as SPV process as above, only different is that we add SR list in the pBFT message.
